##  Overview

This widget places its child at its center. The height and width of the widget can be adjusted using the Width Factor and Height Factor. Accommodates a single child. However, you may add a layout widget as a child that accommodates multiple child widgets.

## Use Cases

* Whenever the child widget needs to be centrally aligned to the parent, the Center widget is useful.
* Child widget can be easily placed at the center.

##  Properties

* The widget's width will be the product of the child width and the `Width Factor`. So, if the width factor is 2.0, the width of the widget will be twice of child's width.
* The widget's height will be the product of the child width and the `Height factor`. So, if the height factor is 1.0, the height of the widget will be the same as the child's height.
