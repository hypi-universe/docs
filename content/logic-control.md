Control blocks have control loops like if-then, if-else, for each, repeat until, etc. Most of the Control loops have [C Blocks](logic-blocks-1.md/#c-blocks). Other blocks can fit inside the C blocks. The code inside the blocks gets executed until the control condition is met.

1. `Repeat Until` block executes the code until the specified condition is met.
2. `For Each` block iterate over a list of items
3. `If-Then` block executes some code if a certain condition is true.
4. `If-Then-Else` block executes some code if the certain condition is true. If false, executes alternate code.
5. `Repeat` block executes a code `N` number of times.
6. `Wait` block executes code after N milliseconds.
