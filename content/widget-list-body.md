![List Body](/img/Widget-List-Body-1.png)

##  Overview

List Body arranges its child widgets sequentially along a given axis, i.e. horizontal or vertical.

##  Use Cases

This widget is rarely used directly. Consider using ListView or Column to arrange child widgets.

##  Properties

* Set Main Axis as `Horizontal` or `Vertical`.
* Set the order of the children as `Reverse` by choosing `true`. This way child widgets will automatically get arranged in reverse order.
