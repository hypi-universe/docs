##  Overview

Text is an important basic widget that is visible and common. It can be a child widget of other visible widgets like Button, Circle Avatar, etc. Properties of the Text content can be changed to provide a different visual appearance. Customize Text Properties like Value, Font, Weight, Size, Alignment, Color, etc to design the visual appearance.

## Use Cases

* Display the text content in your application with this widget.
* Text can be displayed in single line or multiple lines
* The text content within this widget is a static text that can only be changed at runtime using the Logic bindings. For example, at the click of a Button widget, the Text changes from `Yes` to `No`.
* The user cannot edit the Text from this widget. To allow users to edit the text, use the [Text Field](#) widget.

## Properties

* Set the **Value** of the Text content.  The below image displays the Text widget value as `Hello Tink`.

* Handle a visual overflow of text by clipping or fading the overflowing text, adding an ellipsis (â€¦) at the end, or making overflowing text visible outside the widget area.
* Softwrap checks whether the text should break at soft line breaks.
* **The Text Scale Factor** defines the number of font pixels for each logical pixel. If the factor is 1.5, the text font would be 50% bigger than the specified font size.
* **MaxLines** sets the maximum number of lines for the text content. It wraps the text if necessary.
