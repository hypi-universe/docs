2. **How to change Widget Size?**

+ Widgets are arranged in a hierarchy. So, Screen is a parent of Column, Column is a parent of many other widgets, and so on.

+ The size of the widget depends on the parent widget or on the widget itself. For example, the Container widget or the SizedBox widget directly takes width/height.

+ Some widgets will take up only the space they need and some will try to fill out their parent widgets. Check [Layout](widget-layout.md) widgets for the sizing and positioning of the widgets on the screens.

3. **How to change Widget Properties?**

+ Select the widget and you can find the Widget Properties on the right-hand side Properties panel. Provide appropriate values. You can select the widget directly or through Navigator.

4. **How to place Widgets on the screen as per the user interface design?**

+ Take a look at different kinds of [Layout](widget-layout.md).  Divide screen elements into different Layouts and place the widgets on those Layouts.
 + Refer to these [tutorials](#) on different types of Screens.
