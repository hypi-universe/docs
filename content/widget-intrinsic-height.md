## Overview

The Intrinsic Height Layout widget sizes its child to the child's maximum intrinsic height.
When unlimited height is available (like Column widget), the child widget like a Button can expand infinitely. With Intrinsic height, the child widget sizes itself to a more reasonable height.

##  Use Cases

This widget is helpful if the accessible height is limitless, but you need to stop the child width to its intrinsic height.
