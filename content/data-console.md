Console leads to [Hypi's low code backend](https://docs.hypi.app/docs/lowcode/). With Hypi's low code backend, you will have access to various APIs to control the data operations of your application. 

Click `Console` near the Dashboard on the Projects screen.

Hypi's low code backend will open. Here you will find the schema or data models which you created under Data Tables.

Check various APIs and functions provided by Hypi's low code backend [here](https://docs.hypi.app/docs/lowcode/api-references).

You can access APIs and functions provided by the Hypi's low code backend through [Workflow](#) on the Designer board. Only in the case of specific customization like [configuring Serverless functions](https://docs.hypi.app/docs/serverless), you may need to go to Console.
