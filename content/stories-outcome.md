Every action has an outcome. When you add an action, a box to add an outcome would get appended in the flow diagram automatically.

Here are a few examples of outcomes of various actions.

**A) For Patient Information system, **

* A doctor can search patient information history to **_get patient's previous diagnosis details_.**
* A doctor can enter the diagnosis to **_update the current diagnosis_**.
* A nurse can enter the values of health parameters to **_update the details of current health status_**. 
* A receptionist can enter the next appointment date to **_update the appointment information_**.

**B) For Library System,**

* A librarian can search the subscriber details **_to issue a book_**.
* A librarian can make a new book entry **_to update a book database_**.
* A subscriber can search books by an Author **_to get a list of books_**.
