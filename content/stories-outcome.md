Every action has an outcome. When you add an action, a box to add an outcome would get appended in the flow diagram automatically.

Here are a few examples of outcomes of various actions.

A) For Patient Information system, 

A doctor can search patient information history to **get patient's previous diagnosis details.**
A doctor can enter the diagnosis to **update the current diagnosis**.
A nurse can enter the values of health parameters to **update the details of current health status**. 
A receptionist can enter the next appointment date to **update the appointment information**.

B) For Library System,

A librarian can search the subscriber details **to issue a book**.
A librarian can make a new book entry **to update a book database**.
A subscriber can search books by an Author **to get a list of books**.
