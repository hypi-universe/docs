## Overview

Vertical Divider is a thin vertical line that divides the screen into vertical sections. It provides a space between two widgets by drawing a line between them.

## Properties

* You can change the width of the divider to create space between the widgets. The vertical line of the divider gets centered around this height.
* You can also change the color or thickness of the line.
* Provide a leading or trailing indent to adjust the length of the line.
