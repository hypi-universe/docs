## Overview

Divider is a thin horizontal line that divides the screen into horizontal sections. It provides a space between two widgets by drawing a line between them.

## Properties

* You can change the height of the divider to create space between the widgets. The horizontal line of the divider gets centered around this height.
* You can also change the color or thickness of the line.
* Provide a leading or trailing indent to adjust the length of the line.
