##  Overview

Grid Tile Bar is a header used in a Grid Tile. One or two line header or footer can be added using this widget. For one line header, add a title widget such as Text. For the two-line header, add a subtitle widget. Also, add a leading or a trailing widget such as Icon.

##  Properties

* Drag the widgets from the widgets panel to the right-hand side Properties panel. Or you may drag the widget over the Grid Tile widget on the left-hand navigation panel. A pop menu will appear asking for the position of the dragged widget, i.e. title, subtitle, leading, or trailing.
* Choose the color of the Tile Bar as per your choice.
