Using Hypi Tink, you can create, test, and deploy apps from a single platform. Hypi Tink supports deploying Apps to multiple devices with various screen sizes.

The first step to creating a user interface is to add a `screen`. The screen is the interface on which data and images are displayed. You can place [widgets](designer-widgets.md), images over it. The user interacts with the screen of the application.

### 1. **How to add Screen?**

+ Select `Designer` from the Project dashboard to open the Designer board. Go to `Screens` navigation panel on the Left Hand Side and click the `+` sign to add a screen.
