Using Hypi Tink, you can create, test, deploy apps from a single platform. Hypi Tink supports deploying Apps to multiple devices with various screen sizes.

#### Screen

The first step to creating a user interface is to add a screen. The screen is the interface on which data and images are displayed. You can place [widgets](designer-widgets.md), images over it. The user interacts with the screen of the application.

1. **How to add Screen?**

+ Select `Designer` from the Project dashboard to open the Designer board. Go to `Screens` and click the `+` sign to add a screen.

3. **How to change Screen Properties?**

+ You can change the screen background colour through Tink Screen Properties. Select the screen and you can find the Tink Screen Properties on the right-hand side.
+ There is an option to enable Safe Area. While designing the Layout of the application, it is important to consider the preoccupied areas of the screen like the navigation bar, status bar, clocks, etc. Enabling SafeArea provides sufficient padding and makes the screen adaptive and dynamic.
