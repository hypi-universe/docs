##  Overview

After [adding User stories](hypi-tink-stories.md), you will have an idea of what kind of data needs to be stored. Based on that, you can design your data models. From the `App Designer` board, you can go to `Collections` to [add your data models/tables](data-tables.md).

##  Data Tables
1. Click `Database Icon` on the left-hand side of the App Designer Board to add Tables.
