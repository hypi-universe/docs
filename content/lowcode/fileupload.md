Many applications need to upload the file to the backend. Hypi provides a simple API to do so!

Hypi’s core App has a type definition called `File`. A file can be uploaded using an endpoint. Once it is uploaded an object of `File` type gets created. The information about the file gets extracted and stored as a `File` object. The definition includes metadata about the file, the URL to download it, and more. You may place these file objects within your data model. For example, profile picture of a user with his personal information.

The file can be downloaded from the URL given in the object using an authorization token. Anonymous users cannot download the file. To allow access to other users, [permission](authorisation.md#permission) can be granted to download the file.

With this preliminary information, let’s get inside the `File` type definition.
```java
type File {
    name: String!
    directory: String!
    path: String!
    isDirectory: Boolean!
    status: FileStatus
    url: URL
    type: String
    size: Long
    extension: String
    isStared: Boolean
    isSharable: Boolean
    content: String
    children(...): [File!]
}
```

## Upload endpoint

To upload a file (any file can be uploaded, image, pdf, etc), use the following endpoint

`POST /upload/**`

Note the `**`, if you use a path like `/upload/my/path`, then the `File` object will have a directory value of `/my/path`.  If you have many files to upload, you may put all of them in one directory.


## Download endpoint

`GET /file/<path>.ext`

To download a file uploaded to the platform, the above URL pattern should be used.

The `<path>` is by default the `ID` of the `File` object. The `.ext` is the original extension of the file e.g. `.txt`. You may copy the value from `path` field of `File` object.

## curl upload example
```
auth='<hypi-auth-token>'
curl -v https://api.hypi.app/upload/ -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: $auth" -H "hypi-domain: <instance-domain>" -F 0=@/path/to/file.txt
```
+  The response of the upload is JSON
+  The `Authorization` header is required
+  The `hypi-domain` header is required (like other API requests)
+  You may copy the authorization token and hypi instance domain from [GraphQL configuration of the instance](ui-gql-config.md).
+  `@` is the root directory of the file to be uploaded.

In the following example of curl request, we are uploading logo.png file to Hypi domain. `incineration.apps.hypi.app`

```
curl -v https://api.hypi.app/upload/ -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: <auth-token>" -H "hypi-domain: incineration.apps.hypi.app" -F 0=@static/img/logo.png
```
The URL Path could be `https://api.hypi.app/upload/mydir` if you want to upload the file under `mydir` directory.

Here, we have uploaded an image file. So, an `Image` object also gets created that has details of the uploaded image. It contains the File object with file details. 

```
type Image {
    name: String!
    file: File!
    description: String
    location: Geo
}
```

After executing curl command, let's retrieve the details of the file object.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="query"
  values={[
    {label: 'GraphQL Query', value: 'query'},
    {label: 'Response', value: 'response'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="query">

```java

  find(type: File, arcql: "*") {
    edges {
      node {
        ... on File {
          hypi {
            id

<TabItem value="response">

```java
{
  "data": {
    "find": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "hypi": {
              "id": "01F35ZCSYBHTQ4JBWZ1KFXTDZR"
            },
            "name": "logo.png",
            "directory": "/",
            "path": "/logo.png",
            "isDirectory": false,
            "status": "UPLOADED",
            "url": {
              "path": "/file/01F322XSV13R9VAGJXW351PVBT-01F35ZCSYBHTQ4JBWZ1KFXTDZR.png"

          },
          "cursor": "01F35ZCSYBHTQ4JBWZ1KFXTDZR"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## curl download example
```
curl -v https://api.hypi.app/file/<id>.ext -H "Authorization: $auth"
```
Let's download the file that we uploaded earllier. 
```
curl -v https://api.hypi.app/file/01F322XSV13R9VAGJXW351PVBT-01F35ZCSYBHTQ4JBWZ1KFXTDZR.png -H "Authorization: <auth-token>" --output filedownload.png  
```
`--ouput filedownload.png` would redirect the data from the file to an output file.

:::note

You need to create the URL to download a file. Copy the `path` from File object and append it to the hypi endpoint.

:::

In the above example, we provide an authorisation token. This is because file resource is private to the account which created it by default. To give access to other users or allow anonymous download, an access grant must be created for the `File` resource.

To give the anonymous users access (no token required), create an [AccessRight](authorisation.md#accessright) as follows.

```java
mutation {
  upsert(
    values: {
      AccessRight: [
        {
          resource: "01F35ZCSYBHTQ4JBWZ1KFXTDZR"
          resourceType: "File"
          operationType: "Query"
          operation: "*"
          permissionType: RBP
          approved: true
          members: { hypi: { id: "anonymous" } }
        }
      ]
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```
   
Note:  `resource` field has the `hypi.id` of the file uploaded. To grant access to specific users, provide `hypi.id` s of the user Accounts in the `members` field. 
    
In this example, we explicitly give anonymous users access to the file uploaded. 

:::tip IMPORTANT

You need to enable **Anonymous requests** in the [API configurations](https://docs.hypi.app/docs/ui-instance-api-config) for downloading files without authorization headers.

:::

Due to the permission above, the curl request can now be made without any authorisation headers.

`curl -v https://api.hypi.app/file/<id>.ext`

Now you can download the file without the hassle of providing authorization token.

```
curl -v https://api.hypi.app/file/01F322XSV13R9VAGJXW351PVBT-01F35ZCSYBHTQ4JBWZ1KFXTDZR.png --output file.png
```
