Hypi has its own Command Line Interface(CLI) to facilitate using Hypi APIs with Client Applications. Instead of making an HTTP request to Hypi Endpoint, developers can include Hypi as a part of their applications.

CLI synchronizes Hypi APIs with client applications and developers can use them within their own workspace!

## Install Hypi CLI

Go to https://github.com/hypi-universe/cli . Click on `Releases`.  Download Hypi CLI for your operating system with the latest release.  Uncompress the `hypi` folder from the`tar.gz`file.

If you have npm installed,  use the following command to install hypi CLI.
```
$ npm install -g @hypi/cli
```
@hypi/cli => Here, use the entire path of the downloaded Hypi Cli folder

After this, you should have a new `hypi` command available to run. If you do not have `npm` then follow the platform specific steps below to install from the latest binaries.

### Mac

+ Add Hypi CLI folder to the bin folder of Home directory , i.e.` ~/bin`. If this directory doesn't exist then create it.
+ Update the PATH environment variable in `profile` file. 
```
vim ~/.profile
```
```
export PATH="/<PATH TO BIN>/bin/hypi:$PATH"
```
* Replace`<PATH TO BIN>`with the real path to your bin directory where you saved the Hypi binary.

- Open new shell. Provide command `hypi` to verify the installation.
```
hypi
```
```
